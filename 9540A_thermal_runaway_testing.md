Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **simple, high-school-level breakdown** of the math concepts used in **UL 9540A thermal-runaway testing** and the engineering design that comes from it.

---

## üî• 1. What‚Äôs Being Measured

When a battery fails badly enough to **overheat and catch fire**, engineers need to know:

1. **How much heat** comes out.
2. **How fast** it comes out.
3. **What gases** are released (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrofluoric acid).
4. **How big and hot** the fire might get.
5. **If it can spread** to other batteries.

These are measured in the UL 9540A test.
The test gives engineers **numbers** they can use to design **safe spacing, vents, and fire systems**.

---

## üå°Ô∏è 2. Heat and Energy (Fire Power)

### Heat Release Rate (HRR)

* HRR is how fast energy is released as heat.
  Think of it like the **wattage of a heater**.
* Measured in **kilowatts (kW)** or **megawatts (MW)**.

Example:

```
If HRR = 1000 kW (1 MW)
‚Üí that‚Äôs like 1000 space heaters running at once.
```

### Total Heat (Energy)

We add up the HRR over time to get total energy:
[
E = \text{(average heat rate)} \times \text{(time)}
]
This is measured in **megajoules (MJ)**.
It tells us how much total ‚Äúfire energy‚Äù came out.

---

## üí® 3. Gas Release and Ventilation

When batteries burn, they release gases like **hydrogen (H‚ÇÇ)**.
Hydrogen is very light and **explosive at 4% concentration in air** (called the **LFL ‚Äì Lower Flammable Limit**).

We calculate:
[
\text{Concentration} = \frac{\text{Gas released}}{\text{Room air volume}}
]
If that concentration is near 4%, it‚Äôs dangerous.
So we blow in fresh air to keep it below **25% of 4%**, or **1%**.

### Example:

* Room size: 300 m¬≥ (like a big classroom)
* Hydrogen produced: 3 m¬≥
  [
  \text{Concentration} = \frac{3}{300} = 0.01 = 1%
  ]
  ‚úÖ Safe, right at the 25 % of LFL target.

---

## üå¨Ô∏è 4. How Much Ventilation Is Needed

We size fans or vents using:
[
\text{Airflow needed} = \frac{\text{Gas released per second}}{\text{Safe concentration}}
]
If the battery releases **0.002 m¬≥ of hydrogen per second**
and we want to stay at **1 % (0.01)** concentration:
[
Q = \frac{0.002}{0.01} = 0.2\ \text{m¬≥/s} \approx 425\ \text{CFM}
]
(That‚Äôs about what a small industrial fan can handle.)

---

## üåà 5. Radiant Heat (How Fire Spreads)

Fires give off **radiation**‚Äîenergy that can ignite nearby materials.

We use the **inverse square law** (like light and sound):
[
\text{Heat intensity} = \frac{\text{Fire power}}{4 \pi R^2}
]
Where (R) = distance from fire.

If the fire power doubles, the heat doubles.
If the distance doubles, the heat goes down by **four times**.

Engineers compare this heat to known ignition limits:

* Wood burns around **12 kW/m¬≤**
* Plastic melts at **5‚Äì10 kW/m¬≤**

So we make sure the next battery or wall is far enough away.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è 6. Purging Gases Over Time

When fans are on, gases get flushed out:
[
C(t) = C_0 \times e^{-\frac{Qt}{V}}
]
This fancy-looking formula says:

* (C(t)): gas level after some time
* (C_0): starting gas level
* (Q): airflow rate
* (V): room size

The bigger the fan (Q) or smaller the room (V),
the faster gases go away (exponential decay).

---

## üò∑ 7. Toxic Gases (Safety Check)

Not all gases explode‚Äîsome are **toxic**.
Hydrogen fluoride (HF), for example, is dangerous at low levels.

We use simple conversions:
[
1\ \text{ppm of HF} = 0.82\ \text{mg/m¬≥}
]
Then compare to safe limits like **2 ppm short-term** exposure.

## üß† 9. Why It Matters

All of these calculations are **the math behind safe energy systems**:

* Preventing explosions (by keeping hydrogen low)
* Preventing fires from spreading
* Ensuring firefighters and inspectors can enter safely

Here‚Äôs a compact, engineer-grade **math guide** for using UL 9540A report data to design ventilation, spacing, detection, and suppression around thermal-runaway hazards. I‚Äôve kept it practical (plug-and-chug), with the governing equations and what each number comes from.

---

# 1) Know your inputs (from the UL 9540A report)

From the **unit/installation-level** sections pull:

* **Heat Release Rate vs. time** ( \dot Q(t)) [kW] and **peak HRR** ( \dot Q_{\text{pk}}). ([Sandia National Laboratories][1])
* **Gas species mass (or molar) release rates**: at least **H‚ÇÇ, CO, HF** vs. time ( \dot m_i(t)) or peak values. Fifth edition emphasizes **hydrogen** at unit level. ([shopulstandards.com][2])
* **Duration** of significant gas release (t_{\text{rel}}), **visible flame**, **droplets/projectiles**, key **surface/target temperatures**. ([Sandia National Laboratories][1])

Cross-link these data to **IFC/NFPA 855** requirements for HMA, ventilation/deflagration prevention, and protection features. ([ICC Digital Codes][3])

---

# 2) Fire size & energy: use the HRR curve

**Total heat (energy) released** over a window ([t_0,t_1]):
[
E=\int_{t_0}^{t_1}\dot Q(t),dt \quad [\text{MJ}] \quad\text{(numerically integrate the HRR trace)}
]
Use trapezoids on the tabulated HRR(t). This drives exposure, sprinkler expectations, and scenario selection. (HRR fundamentals: SFPE references.) ([SFPE][4])

# 3) Radiant/convective exposure to nearby targets

A simple, conservative **point-source radiation** check to estimate radiant flux at distance (R):

q''*{\text{rad}} ;=; \chi_r \frac{\dot Q}{4\pi R^2}\quad [\text{kW/m}^2]
]
where (\chi_r) (radiative fraction) is often 0.2‚Äì0.35 for hydrocarbon-like flaming; pick conservatively unless your 9540A report provides a better value. Compare (q''*{\text{rad}}) to **critical heat flux for ignition** of adjacencies (e.g., piloted ignition of wood often cited around **12.5 kW/m¬≤**, with literature variability). ([Scribd][5])

Add convection if you have local measurements:
[
q''*{\text{conv}} ;=; h\left(T_s-T*\infty\right)
]
then (q''*{\text{tot}}=q''*{\text{rad}}+q''*{\text{conv}}). Ceiling jet (for detection/sprinklers, damage checks) can use **Alpert** correlations with HRR and ceiling height (H):
[
\Delta T*{\text{jet}}=\begin{cases}
16.9,\dfrac{\dot Q^{2/3}}{H^{5/3}}, & r/H\le 0.18[6pt]
5.38\left(\dfrac{\dot Q}{r}\right)^{2/3}\dfrac{1}{H}, & r/H>0.18
\end{cases}
]
(with (r) = radial distance). ([NIST][6])

# 4) Gas hazard math (H‚ÇÇ/CO/HF): concentration, %LFL, and ventilation

**4.1 Well-mixed room model (transient)**
For a room of volume (V) ([m^3]) with ventilation (Q) ([m^3/s]) and a source (G) ([m^3/s]) (or mol/s) of a gas:
[
\frac{dC}{dt}=\frac{G}{V}-\frac{Q}{V}C \quad\Rightarrow\quad
C(t)=C_\infty\Big(1-e^{-\frac{Q}{V}t}\Big)+C(0),e^{-\frac{Q}{V}t}
]
Steady state: (C_\infty=\dfrac{G}{Q}). Use species molar/volumetric generation (G) from 9540A or convert mass to molar/volumetric. ([me.psu.edu][7])

**4.2 Purge/clear time**
If you start at (C_0) and exhaust to (C_{\text{target}}):
[
t_{\text{purge}}=\frac{V}{Q},\ln!\left(\frac{C_0}{C_{\text{target}}}\right)
]
(useful for post-event purge design). ([me.psu.edu][7])

**4.3 LFL checks and NFPA 69 criterion**
For **single gas**, percent of LFL:
[
%\text{LFL} = 100\times \frac{C}{\text{LFL}}
\quad\text{(H‚ÇÇ LFL ‚âà 4 % v/v in air at ambient)}
]
NFPA 69 practice keeps the **global** flammable gas below **25 % of LFL** (or up to 60 % with certain interlocked instrumentation). Use this as your **design limit** unless the AHJ dictates lower. ([AIChE][8])

For **fuel mixtures**, use **Le Chatelier‚Äôs mixing rule**:
[
\frac{1}{\text{LFL}*\text{mix}}=\sum_i \frac{y_i}{\text{LFL}*i}
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
%\text{LFL}*\text{mix}=100\times \frac{C*\text{tot}}{\text{LFL}_\text{mix}}
]
with (y_i) the volume (mole) fraction of each flammable species in the mixture. ([digitalcommons.mtu.edu][9])

**4.4 Unit conversions (ppm ‚Üî mg/m¬≥) and toxic checks (HF)**
At 25 ¬∞C, 1 atm:
[
\text{mg/m}^3 = \frac{\text{ppm}\times \text{MW}}{24.45},\qquad
\text{ppm} = \frac{24.45\times \text{mg/m}^3}{\text{MW}}
]
**HF**: 1 ppm ‚âà 0.82 mg/m¬≥ (MW = 20.01). Compare to RELs/STELs if you‚Äôre documenting personnel exposure limits in an HMA. ([AIHA][10])

---

# 5) Ventilation sizing from 9540A gas data

Let (G_{H_2}) be the **peak** or **representative** volumetric generation rate of hydrogen (account for concurrent CO or other fuels via Le Chatelier if needed). To keep global concentration at or below a set fraction (f) of LFL (e.g., (f=0.25) for 25 % of LFL):
[
Q_{\text{req}} ;\ge; \frac{G_{H_2}}{C_{\text{limit}}}
\quad\text{with}\quad C_{\text{limit}}=f\times \text{LFL}*{H_2} ;=; f\times 0.04;\text{(v/v)}
]
If 9540A reports **mass** rate (\dot m*{H_2}) ([kg/s]), convert to volumetric at ambient:
[
G_{H_2}=\frac{\dot m_{H_2}}{\rho_{H_2}}\qquad
(\rho_{H_2}\approx 0.0838\ \text{kg/m}^3 \text{ @ 25 ¬∞C, 1 atm})
]
Then check **transient**: verify (C(t)) never exceeds (C_{\text{limit}}) for the measured release profile (\dot m(t)). Where installation-level data show multi-peak releases, size for the **worst credible 10‚Äì15 min window** or per AHJ direction. (IFC/NFPA 855 reference 9540A gas data for HMA; explosion prevention commonly follows NFPA 69 25 % LFL.) ([ICC Digital Codes][3])

---

# 6) Example (numerical, ready to adapt)

**Given (9540A unit-level):**

* Peak HRR ( \dot Q_{\text{pk}}=1.2\ \text{MW}); integral over event (E=900\ \text{MJ}).
* Peak **hydrogen** mass rate (\dot m_{H_2}=0.010\ \text{kg/min}=1.67\times10^{-4}\ \text{kg/s}) for 12 min.
* Indoor room (V=300\ \text{m}^3); target (f=25%) of LFL (H‚ÇÇ LFL = 4 % v/v).

**Ventilation (steady-state minimum):**
[
G_{H_2}=\frac{1.67\times10^{-4}}{0.0838}=1.99\times10^{-3}\ \text{m}^3/\text{s}
]
[
C_{\text{limit}}=0.25\times0.04=0.01\ \text{(v/v)}
]
[
Q_{\text{req}}=\frac{1.99\times10^{-3}}{0.01}=0.199\ \text{m}^3/\text{s}
;=; 422\ \text{cfm}
]
Round up and add margin/interlocks per NFPA 69; if mixture includes CO/HCs, compute (\text{LFL}_\text{mix}) with Le Chatelier and re-solve. ([ammoniaknowhow.com][11])

**Transient check:** with (Q=500\ \text{cfm}=0.236\ \text{m}^3/s),
[
\frac{dC}{dt}=\frac{G}{V}-\frac{Q}{V}C
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\tau=\frac{V}{Q}=1271\ \text{s}\ (\approx21.2\ \text{min})
]
Peak occurs before steady-state; verify (C(t)) numerically using the measured (G(t)). If peak exceeds 1 % v/v, increase (Q) or add emergency purge on high H‚ÇÇ. ([me.psu.edu][7])

**Separation via radiation (screening):**
With (\chi_r=0.25), (\dot Q=1.2\ \text{MW}), at (R=2.5\ \text{m}):
[
q''_{\text{rad}}=0.25\times\frac{1200}{4\pi(2.5)^2}\approx3.8\ \text{kW/m}^2
]
Well below 12.5 kW/m¬≤ ‚Üí unlikely piloted ignition of wood-like combustibles from **radiation alone**; still check **convection/ceiling jet** if overhead items are vulnerable. ([Scribd][5])

**Ceiling jet (detector/sprinkler screening):**
Ceiling height (H=4.0\ \text{m}), (r=2.0\ \text{m}\Rightarrow r/H=0.5>0.18):
[
$$\Delta T_{\text{jet}}=
5.38\left(\frac{1200}{2}\right)^{2/3}\frac{1}{4}
\approx 5.38,(600)^{2/3}/4 \approx 5.38\times71.1/4\approx95\ ^\circ\text{C}$$
]
Use this to sanity-check thermal device activation predictions (DETACT/LAVENT) if needed. ([NIST][6])

* **Point-source radiation**: $$(q''=\chi_r \dot Q/(4\pi R^2))$$. Compare to ~**12.5 kW/m¬≤** piloted-ignition screen for wood-like materials (literature range). ([Scribd][5])
